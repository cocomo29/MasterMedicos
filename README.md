A simple web app to show data manipulation via Flask and SSMS.

# ðŸš€ Getting Started
Copy the script from [this file] and execute it in SQL Server.

Once you've created the tables in SSMS, go to [main.py] and edit the credentials. (you only have to change server and database in line 7 and 8)

Type `py main.py` in the project's directory or directly run [main.py]

If all goes well, your webapp will be deployed on localhost:5000 (127.0.0.1:5000)

Type /admin in url (127.0..1:5000/admin) to perform CRUD operations in your database.
